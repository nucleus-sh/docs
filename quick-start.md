# ðŸ¦¸ Quick Start

## Install the library

The best way to interact with our API is to use one of our official libraries.

By following this short guide you will have the basic functionalities (analytics and bug reports) working in 5 minutes.

### Create an app <a href="#create-an-app" id="create-an-app"></a>

Start by [signing up](https://www.nucleus.sh/signup) on the platform.

Then, create your first app. Name it as you want, you can change it later.

If you already have a version or an icon, you can edit the app to set those.

### Integrate <a href="#integrate" id="integrate"></a>

Choose the appropriate module for your application, or use the API to report data if no module is available for your usecase.

* [Browser](modules/browser.md)
* [Electron / Node.js](broken-reference)
* [Python](modules/python.md)
* [Swift (Mac OS)](modules/swift.md)
* [Custom Tracking API](reference/tracking-api.md)

Be sure to add the correct `<App Id>` when starting the module.

That's it ðŸ¤Ÿ

Open your app, and you should be able to see your first user in the Nucleus dashboard.
